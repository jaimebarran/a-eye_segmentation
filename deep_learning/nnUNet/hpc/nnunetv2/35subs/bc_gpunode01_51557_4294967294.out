*Best*: nnUNetTrainer__nnUNetPlans__3d_fullres: 0.8634762120238553

***Determining postprocessing for best model/ensemble***
Removing all but the largest foreground region did not improve results!
Results were improved by removing all but the largest component for 1. Dice before: 0.88133 after: 0.88186
Removing all but the largest component for 2 did not improve results! Dice before: 0.95675 after: 0.95675
Removing all but the largest component for 3 did not improve results! Dice before: 0.86399 after: 0.86399
Removing all but the largest component for 4 did not improve results! Dice before: 0.81669 after: 0.81664
Removing all but the largest component for 5 did not improve results! Dice before: 0.77526 after: 0.64488

***Run inference like this:***

nnUNetv2_predict -d Dataset313_Eye -i INPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -f  0 1 2 3 4 -tr nnUNetTrainer -c 3d_fullres -p nnUNetPlans

***Once inference is completed, run postprocessing like this:***

nnUNetv2_apply_postprocessing -i OUTPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER_PP -pp_pkl_file /opt/nnunet_resources/nnUNet_results/Dataset313_Eye/nnUNetTrainer__nnUNetPlans__3d_fullres/crossval_results_folds_0_1_2_3_4/postprocessing.pkl -np 8 -plans_json /opt/nnunet_resources/nnUNet_results/Dataset313_Eye/nnUNetTrainer__nnUNetPlans__3d_fullres/crossval_results_folds_0_1_2_3_4/plans.json
