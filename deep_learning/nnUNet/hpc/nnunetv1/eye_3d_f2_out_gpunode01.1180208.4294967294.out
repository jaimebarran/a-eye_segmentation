WARNING: CUDA Minor Version Compatibility mode ENABLED.
  Using driver version 455.23.04 which has support for CUDA 11.1.  This container
  was built with CUDA 11.6 and will be run in Minor Version Compatibility mode.
  CUDA Forward Compatibility is preferred over Minor Version Compatibility for use
  with this container but was unavailable:
  [[No CUDA-capable device is detected (CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE) cuInit()=100]]
  See https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/ for details.

NOTE: Mellanox network driver detected, but NVIDIA peer memory driver not
      detected.  Multi-node communication performance may be reduced.

I am running the following nnUNet: 3d_fullres
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:

use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, False)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'nonCT')])
