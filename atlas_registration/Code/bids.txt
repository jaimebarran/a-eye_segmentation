BIDS tutorial

Finally, we’ve created the configuration file; now the BIDS conversion can be performed. For this, we’ll assume that the subject ID is 01 and that this is a single session study. Type the following on the command line:

$ dcm2bids_scaffold -o $HOME/BIDS_tutorial
$ echo "study imaging data" > $HOME/BIDS_tutorial/README
$ dcm2bids -d $HOME/BIDS_tutorial/BIDS_tutorial_data -p 01 -c $HOME/BIDS_config.json -o $HOME/BIDS_tutorial --forceDcm2niix

$ dcm2bids -d ./BIDS_tutorial_data/ -p 01 -c ./BIDS_config.json -o . --forceDcm2niix


If however this were multi-session data (i.e. participant was scanned more than once), the dcm2bids command will look like this, where the -s 01 indicates that this is the first session. -s 02 would indicate the second session, and so on.:

$ dcm2bids_scaffold -o $HOME/BIDS_tutorial
$ echo "study imaging data" > $HOME/BIDS_tutorial/README
$ dcm2bids -d $HOME/BIDS_tutorial/BIDS_tutorial_data -p 01 -s 01 -c $HOME/BIDS_config.json -o $HOME/BIDS_tutorial --forceDcm2niix

Clean the project.
Type the following onto the command line, line by line:

$ mv $HOME/BIDS_tutorial/BIDS_tutorial_data $HOME/BIDS_tutorial/sourcedata
$ rm -rf $HOME/BIDS_tutorial/tmp_dcm2bids
